Creating UML diagrams with PlantUML

Are lots of types of different UML diagram types that can be created as diagrams as code.
Classes, objects, interfaces or Abstract objects are joined by lines, with differing line types having different significance
The standard way of doing diagrams is to have class objects, with attributes followed by methods.

Are many kinds of relationships between classes which are defined by the line type.
It is possible to replace -- by .. to have a dotted line
Can add a direction to line (in middle .down.>) or add text at either end ("1" ..> "2")

Different line types:
-Generalization: Refers to the relationship between the parent class and the child class
 -Inheritance: If the parent class is an abstract class or a normal class                   (Empty Arrows)          <|--  --|>
 -Implementation: if the parent class is an interface                                                               <|..  ..|>
-Aggregation: Relationship between parent and child class, can function without each other  (Empty Diamond)         o--   --o
-Composition: Strong ownership between two classes, Child never exist independently         (Filled Diamond)        *--   --*
-Rely: Weakest association between classes. Use other class objects as parameters, local variables or call methods  <..   ..>

In my diagrams will mainly use rely as I don't yet use parent and child classes with
Alt-D shows a PlantUML preview, to create final diagram cmd palette and 'plantuml: export current diagram' and choose the format

@startuml
scale 2
class Car {
  color: string
  model: integer
  +start()
  +run()
  +stop()
}

Car <|- Bus
Car *-down- Tire
Car *-down- Engine
Bus "1" o-down- "2" Driver

===Options

-Add Titles to the page and also add new pages to scroll through
title Function Diagram
newpage
title Function Diagram

-Colours
skinparam monochrome true               Black and White
skinparam monochrome reverse            Reverse colours, so black background, white front

skinparam packageStyle rect             ??????

-Layout
left to write direction                 The direction of diagram, so goes left to write (default) up to down)

-Macros can set variables and add code such as conditionals, loops mindmaps, create modules, functions, etc

-Set the to specific scale of the diagrams, by default is autoscale
scale x

-UML has 9 types of diagrams with different element types. Use 'allowmixing' if you want to mix classes and other UML elements

class Abstract
actor Actor

===Class
Are two ways to create a class, either with or without {}. Both give the same result

ArrayList : Object[] elementData
ArrayList : Object[] elementData1
ArrayList : size()
ArrayList : size1()

class ArrayList1 {
    Object[] elementData
    Object[] elementData1
    size()
    size1()
}

-Classes always have 3 sections with the divide between the 2nd and 3rd decided by where the first method is (end in ()).
This can be overridden and manually set by using --
class ArrayList1 {
    --
    Object[] elementData
    --
    Object[] elementData1
    size()
}

-By default all classes have a 'C' in a circle. This can be changed using the following, the 2nd part is the circle colour.
class System << (S,#FF7700) Singleton >>
class function << (F,orange) >>

This same thing can be done with the {} fromat:
class main << (F,orange) >> {
    elementData
    Object[] elementData1
    size
    size1()
}

===object
Is same as class but only has two fields and no Letter and circle.

object user
user : name = "Dummy"
user : id = 123

Again this can be written in {} format with -- used to add 3rd field (not automatic)
object user {
    name = "Dummy"
    id = 123
    --
    test
}
